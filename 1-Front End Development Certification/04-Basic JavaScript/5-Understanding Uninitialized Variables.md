# Understanding Uninitialized Variables 

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

## Instructions
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

## Tests: 
* a should be defined and have a value of 6
* b should be defined and have a value of 15
* c should not contain undefined and should have a value of "I am a String!"
* Do not change code below the line
