# Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables 
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

## Best Practice
Write variable names in Javascript in `camelCase`. In `camelCase`, `multi-word` variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

## Examples:

```js
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;
```

## Instructions
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

## Tests: 

* studlyCapVar is defined and has a value of 10
* properCamelCase is defined and has a value of "A String"
* titleCaseOver is defined and has a value of 9000
* studlyCapVar should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
* properCamelCase should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
* titleCaseOver should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
