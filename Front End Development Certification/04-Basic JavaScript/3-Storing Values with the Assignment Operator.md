# Storing Values with the Assignment Operator 
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

Assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
Assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.

## Instructions
