## Build a Tribute Page 

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
