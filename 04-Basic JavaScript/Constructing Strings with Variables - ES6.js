// Constructing Strings with Variables - ES6.js

// Example
let ourName = "Free Code Camp";
let ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
let myName = "Daniel Lim";
let myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am swell!";

// ES6 - using "Template Strings"
let myStr = `My name is ${myName} and I am swell!`;

// BUT - This code (above) does not work since ... 
// the test is looking for : 
// "Use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it"
