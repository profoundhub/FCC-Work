<p class="challengeText"><span class="default">Intro: </span>
So far, you've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript. With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.<br><br>

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: <code>ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)</code>.

<ul>
<li>The first argument is the React element or component that you want to render.</li>
<li>The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component within.</li>
</ul>

As you would expect, <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.</p>
